                        I'm Hari. I'm a Senior Data Specialist, specializing in data warehousing in Snowflake and data modelling with dbt with seasoned experience in Azure services, particularly in Azure Data Factory, Azure Functions, Azure Databricks, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Logic Apps.<br><br>
                        SQL Server, HANA and SAP BW are some other warehouses I am experienced in. ETL experience with HVR, Fivetran and BODS.<br><br>
                        I am hyped about automating things in life leveraging my ability to be the right-amount-of-lazy. Smart homes, python accelerators for every mundane task - like choosing what to eat, setting alarms, controlling temperature and lights, I use Python and shell scripts to control all accelerators and Docker is my new found love. <br><br>

                            This project helps quickly create boilerplate dbt models from your requirements instantly without errors and immediately focus on implementing business logic.

                            <h3>meal-manager</h3>
                            A very simple meal manager based on user-defined recipes. The main focus of this project is to integrate with Siri through Siri Shortcuts, so that I can always know what I can cook with whatever is available in my grocery list.<br>Although this began as a personal project that runs on a little Raspberry Pi 3b at home, I'm expanding this into a generally-available service soon. This is still in early development, you can visit my repo and have a fork (or spoon :P).

                            I built this website as a fun project, just to learn how HTML and CSS work. Head to the Github repo.
